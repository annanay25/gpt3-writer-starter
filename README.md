Here's an example of this in action -

```
Human: Based on the best industry standards, the following is a numbered list of Neural Network layers to perform object detection over image data:

AI: 1. Convolutional Layer: This layer is used to extract features from the image data.
2. Activation Layer: This layer is used to introduce non-linearity into the network.
3. Pooling Layer: This layer is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data and to make the network more robust to small variations in the input.
4. Fully Connected Layer: This layer is used to connect the neurons of the previous layer to the neurons of the output layer.
5. Output Layer: This layer is used to generate the final output of the network. It can be either a single neuron for binary classification or multiple neurons for multi-class classification.

Human: To implement the above model in Python using the PyTorch framework, the following uncommented code can be used:

AI: Neural Networks
The following code implements the above mentioned model:

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class ConvNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, 120)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 5 * 5)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

model = ConvNet()
```
